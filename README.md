# Agent Foundry

Agent Foundry is an experimental infrastructure for augmenting knowledge work through coordinated use of AI agents.

## Getting Started

### Launch with VSCode Dev Containers
1. Install the **Dev Containers** extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) in VSCode
2. Open this repository
3. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**

The first launch will take a few minutes to build the Docker image.

### Connect to the container from a terminal
While the container is running, you can connect from another terminal:

```bash
docker exec -it agent-foundry bash
```
